- **Security**
  - Sets up UFW firewall (allows only SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
  - Installs and configures fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks
  - Configures unattended-upgrades for automatic security updates
  - Implements secure SSH configuration

- **Docker**
  - Installs Docker and Docker Compose
  - Adds user to docker group

- **System Updates**
  - Configures automatic security updates
  - Sets up unattended-upgrades with email notifications
  - Automatic system cleanup

- **Coolify Installation (Optional)**
  - Install Coolify
  - Open temporary ports (8000, 6001, 6002)
  - Provide instructions for securing after domain setup

## üöÄ Usage

There are two options on how to use this script:

1. Run the (interactive) setup script (`setup-interactive.sh`) on your local machine or vps.

2. Duplicate this repository, configure the variables as Secrets and use the included github action (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automatically run this script on your VPS when you push your updates.

### Option 1. Run the script


You can run this script on your local machine or vps. It is necessary, that you have root ssh access to your remote VPS. 

`VPS_HOST` ist your vps hostname or ip adress.

a) On your local machine
```bash
ssh root@VPS_HOST "bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legout/vps-setup/refs/heads/main/setup-interactive.sh)"
```
b) On your VPS
```bash
ssh root@VPS_HOST

# you are on your remote VPS now
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legout/vps-setup/refs/heads/main/setup-interactive.sh)
```

### Option 2: GitHub Action
#### 1. Duplicate this Repository
Duplicate this repository and make it private to safely store your configurations.

1.
```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/legout/vps-setup.git
```
2.
```bash
cd vps-setup
git push --mirror https://github.com/<your-github-username>/vps-setup.git
```
3.
```bash
cd ..
rm -r vps-setup
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/vps-setup.git
```


#### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
In your forked repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

- `VPS_HOST`: Your VPS IP address or hostname
- `VPS_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Initial root password
- `VPS_USER`: Desired username for the non-root user
- `VPS_USER_PASSWORD`: Password for the new user
- `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your SSH public key content (from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)
- `INSTALL_COOLIFY`: Set to "true" to install Coolify, "false" to skip (defaults to "false")
- `AUTO_REBOOT`: Set to "true" for automatic reboot after system updates, "false" to skip (defaults to "false")
- `REMOVE_UNUSED_DEPS`: Set to "true" to remove unused dependencies, "false" to skip (defaults to "false")

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:
- Never commit these values directly to the repository
- Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
- Use strong passwords for both root and user accounts
- Keep your SSH private key secure

#### 3. Deploy
The setup will automatically deploy when you push to the main branch, or you can manually trigger it from the Actions tab.

#### 4. Post-Setup Security Steps

After the GitHub Action completes successfully:

1. Test SSH key-based login:
```bash
ssh your-user@your-vps-host
```

2. If SSH key access works, disable password authentication:
```bash
ssh your-user@your-vps-host 'sudo sed -i "s/PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/" /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
- Only disable password authentication after confirming SSH key access works
- Keep a backup of your SSH private key
- Store your VPS root password securely (in case of emergencies)
- Monitor the GitHub Actions logs for the setup result

##### Coolify Configuration

The setup includes an optional Coolify installation with temporary open ports:
- 8000/tcp: Coolify Web UI
- 6001/tcp: Coolify Websocket
- 6002/tcp: Coolify Terminal

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: After configuring your domain in Coolify and setting up SSL, remove these temporary ports:
```bash
ssh your-user@your-vps-host 'sudo ufw delete allow 8000/tcp && sudo ufw delete allow 6001/tcp && sudo ufw delete allow 6002/tcp'
```

These ports should only be open during initial setup. Once you've configured your domain and SSL in Coolify, all traffic should go through ports 80/443.

### üìã What Gets Installed

- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- fail2ban
- unattended-upgrades
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Essential system utilities
- Coolify (optinal)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### Firewall Rules
- Default: deny incoming, allow outgoing
- Allowed incoming ports:
  - 22 (SSH)
  - 80 (HTTP)
  - 443 (HTTPS)

### fail2ban Configuration
- Monitors SSH authentication
- Bans IP after 3 failed attempts
- Ban duration: 1 hour
- Monitor window: 10 minutes

### Automatic Updates
- Daily security updates
- Automatic removal of unused packages
- Configured reboot at 2 AM if necessary
- Email notifications for important updates

### SSH Security
- Key-based authentication only
- Root login disabled
- Password authentication enabled. For security reasons you should disable it after successfull setup (see [Post-Setup Security Steps](#4-post-setup-security-steps) below)


## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

1. Fork this repository
2. Modify `setup.sh` according to your needs
3. Update the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` if necessary
4. Set up your secrets
5. Deploy!

## üìà Security Recommendations

- Always keep your SSH private key secure
- Regularly update your SSH keys
- Monitor system logs regularly
- Keep Docker and system packages updated
- Review automatic update logs periodically

## üîç Monitoring

After deployment, you can monitor various aspects:

- Fail2ban logs: `/var/log/fail2ban.log`
- UFW logs: `/var/log/ufw.log`
- Unattended upgrades: `/var/log/unattended-upgrades/`
- System logs: `/var/log/syslog`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This script is designed for Debian-based systems (tested on Debian 12)
- Ensure you have root access to your VPS before running
- Make sure to test the setup in a development environment first
- Keep your forked repository private to protect sensitive information
- Regularly update your SSH keys and monitor system logs
